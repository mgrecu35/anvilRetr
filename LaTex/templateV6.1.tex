\section{Introduction}
The future NASA Atmospheric Observing System (AOS) mission (Braun 2022) is expected to feature new 
combinations of observations that may be used to quantify the amounts of ice in high clouds and 
characterize the microphysical properties of ice particles. These observations include lidar backscatter,
 Ku-band radar reflectivity and submillimeter wave radiometer brightness temperature measurements.  
 While not optimal for cloud ice estimation, but for the characterization of a broader spectrum of 
 cloud and precipitation processes, these observations are nevertheless synergistic from the 
 characterization of ice clouds perspective. That is, despite the fact that lidar observations 
 attenuate quickly in thick ice clouds and the Ku-band radar will not be able to detect clouds 
 characterized by an echo weaker than 8.0 dBZ, the active observations are expected to provide context 
 that may be incorporated into radiometer retrievals. In this study, we investigate the impact of 
 incorporating the lidar and radar observations into the radiometer retrieval of ice clouds.
 Because the existent amount of coincident backscatter lidar, Ku-band radar, and submillimeter-wave 
 radiometer observations is rather insufficient to derive conclusive results, we employ accurate 
 physical models to simulate the lidar, radar and radiometer observations and use a cross-validation 
 methodology to characterize the retrieval accuracy. As retrievals from passive instrument 
 observations strongly depend on the "a priori" information (Rodgers 2000), for the results to be 
 relevant in real applications it is necessary to base them on realistic vertical distributions of 
 ice properties.  Such distributions may be derived from cloud-resolving-model (CRM) simulations 
 (Pfreundschuh et al. 2020) or directly from observations.  In this study, we employ the latter 
 approach, as CRMs may still be deficient in properly reproducing the vertical distribution of ice 
 clouds and their associated microphysical properties.  Specifically, we use observation and
 products from the CloudSat (CS) mission (Stephens et al. 2002) to derive a database of ice microphysical
 properties and associated simulated lidar, radar and radiometer observations.  The database is used to
investigate the accuracy of the retrieved ice cloud properties from the simulated observations. The article
is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we describe the approach used to derive the ice properties and
the associated simulated observations, the retrieval and the evaluation methodology.  In Section 3, we 
present the results of the evaluation methodology. We conclude in Section 4.

\section{Methodology}
As previously mentioned, we use CloudSat (CS) observations (Stephens et 2002) to derive the vertical 
distributions of ice properties needed in the investigation.  Although research quality CS cloud ice 
products exist, to maximize the physical consistency of the approach, we do not use them but derive ice amounts
and associated properties directly from CS reflectivity observations.  This ensures the consistency between 
the particle
distribution assumptions and the electromagnetic scattering properties used in the CS reflectivity processing 
and those used the simulation of the lidar, Ku-band radar and radiometer observations.  Lidar, Ku-band radar 
and submillimeter-wave radiometer observations are simulated from CS observations using accurate physical 
models and realistic assumptions consistent with the most recent knowledge in the field of ice cloud 
microphysics, and a non-parametric estimation methodology based on the k-Means clustering algorithm 
\cite{mackay2003information} is used to 
investigate the instrument synergy.  Details of the methodology are presented below.

\subsection{Assumptions and forward models}
To quantify the number of ice particles in an elementary atmospheric volume as a function of their size, we use
normalized gamma functions (Bringi et al. 2003).  The benefit of normalized gamma functions is that they 
encapsulate the variability of Ice Water Content (IWC) - reflectivity relationship into a single parameter,
i.e. the 
normalized Particle Size Distribution (PSD) intercept (Testud et al. 2001; Bringi et al. 2003). The normalized
PSD intercept is defined as $N_w=\frac {4^4} {\pi \rho_w} \frac {IWC} {D_m^4}$, where $IWC$ is the ice water 
content associated with the PSD, and $D_m$ is the mass weighted mean diameter.  Testud et al. (2001) showed 
that the variability in IWC reflectivity (Z) relationships may be fully explained by variability in $N_w$, and 
that a formula of the type
\begin{equation}
IWC=N_w^{1-b}aZ^b \label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
perfectly explains the relationships between IWC and Z calculated from observed PSDs. Equation (\ref{eq:1}) is not 
sufficient to derive accurate, unbiased estimates of ice water contents, because $N_w$ varies considerably in 
time and space. Nevertheless, multiple studies showed that it is beneficial to parameterize $N_w$ as a function 
of various variables, such as temperature (e.g. Hogan et al. 2006; Delanoe and Hogan 2008; Deng et al. 2010), 
rather than using $N_w$ independent relations.  In this study we parameterize
$N_w$ as a function of temperature based on the CloudSat 2C-ICE product (Deng et al. 2010; Deng et al. 2013).  
Specifically, we cluster, based on their similarity, a large set 2C-ICE profiles into 18 classes using a k-Means 
procedure. The mean IWC profiles associated with the 18 classes are shown in continuous lines in Fig. 1.  
Alternative estimates, based on the PSD assumptions and electromagnetic scattering calculations that enable 
accurate and physically consistent simulations of radar observations at Ku-band and radiometer observations of 
submillimeter-wave frequencies are also shown in Fig. 1 (symbolized as SSRG). Details regarding the estimations 
process are provided in the subsequent paragraphs.  As apparent in Fig. 1, the CS and SSRG estimates are in good 
agreement.  Some discrepancies due to discrepancies in the SSRG $N_w$ parameterization and the CS 2C-ICE 
"a priori assumptions" are also apparent, but they are not deemed critical in this study, whose objective is 
the investigation of synergistic lidar, Ku-band radar and submillimeter-wave radiometer retrievals, because the 
outcome is not likely to be sensitive to such details.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth,angle=0]{./Figs/iwcClassesSSRG_CS.png}\\
    \caption{}\label{f1}
\end{figure}
One may notice that the average IWC profiles in Fig.1 are characterized by different peak values and locations. 
This facilitates a simple way to reverse-engineer to (some extent) the "a priori" assumptions used in the CS 
2C-ICE product and use them in formulation of the type described in Eq. (1).  Specifically, the conditional 
derivation of relationships of the type $IWC=a_i Z^{b_i}$ for every class i and the representation of $a_i$ as 
a function of the height of class IWC peak. Shown in Fig. 2 is a class multiplicative coefficient as a function of
relative height scatter plot.  As 
apparent in the figure, and as expected, the $a_i$ exhibits a strong variation with the relative height. 
Coefficient $b_i$ exhibits a height dependency as well, but the range of variation is significantly smaller, 
almost zero relative to the mean value of $b$. Given that any deviation of the multiplicative coefficient in 
an IWC-Z relation from an average is equivalent to a deviation of the associated $N_w$ from its mean value 
(Testud et al. 2001), the relative height $a$ relationship may be converted into a relative-height $N_w$ 
relationship.  We, therefore, use the data in Fig. 2 to parameterize $N_w$ as a function of the relative height.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth,angle=0]{./Figs/iwcCoeff.png}\\
    \caption{}\label{f2}
\end{figure}

For the determination of the reference $a$ and $b$ values, we assume that PSDs are normalized gamma 
distributions with $N_w=0.08cm^{-4}$ and $\mu=2$ and calculate 

\begin{equation}
 Z=\frac {\lambda ^4} {\pi ^5 |K_w|^2} \int_0^{\infty} N(D,D_m) \sigma _b(D) dD
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the radar frequency, $|K_w|$ is the dielectric factor of water, $N(D,D_m) dD$ is the number 
of ice particles of diameter with D and D+dD per unit volume, $D_m$ is the mass weighted mean diameter of the 
distribution, and $\sigma _b(D)$ is the backscattering cross-section of ice particle of diameter $D$. The mass 
weighted mean diameter is equidistantly sampled to span the entire range of IWC values in the CS 2C-ICE dataset.
The assumed mass-size relation is that of Brown and Francis (1995) because it works well with the 
self-similarity Rayleigh-Gans approximation (SSRGA) of Hogan et al. (2017) upon the electromagnetic scattering 
property calculations are based (Heymsfield et al. 2022).  The open source software scatter-1.1 of Hogan (2019) 
is used to provide the actual scattering properties. The SSRGA theory was developed for millimeter and 
submillimeter-wave calculations and may not be applicable at lidar's wavelength.  Therefore, for lidar 
calculations, we are using the Mie solution of scatter-1.1. Although more accurate calculations based on more 
realistic ice particle shapes exist, they are rather incomplete and not readily available.  Moreover, Wagner 
and Deleny (2022) compared lidar backscatter observations with backscatter calculations based on coincident PSD 
observations and the Mie solution and found good agreement, which suggests that electromagnetic properties 
derived from Mie calculations are adequate for practical applications. The lidar molecular backscatter and 
extinction are calculated using the lidar module of COSP stands for CFMIP Observation Simulator Package 
(COSP; Bodas-Salcedo et al. 2011).  To account for multiple-scattering in the lidar observations, we are using 
the multiscatter-1.2.11 model (Hogan 2015) of Hogan and Battaglia (2008).

The radiometer observations are calculated using a one-dimensional efficient, but accurate, radiative transfer 
solver based on Eddington's approximation (Kummerow 1993). The Eddington's approximation has been found to work 
well in cloud and precipitation retrieval application despite its simplicity relative to more general (but also 
computationally intensive) approaches such as the Monte Carlo radiative transfer solvers (Liu et al. 1996). 
It should be noted tough that the phase functions of ice particles tend to be highly asymmetric at 
sub-millimeter wave frequencies. For radiative transfer solutions based on the Eddington's approximation to be 
accurate it is necessary that the delta-scaling approach (Joseph et al. 1976) be employed. The delta-scaling 
approach transforms the initial radiative transfer equation into an equivalent one characterized by a less 
asymmetric scattering function, but more extinction and making the solution Eddington approximation more stable 
and accurate. The absorption due to water vapor and other gases is quantified using the Rosenkranz model 
(Rosenkranz 1998).  The water vapor, temperature and pressure distributions are derived based on a WRF 
simulation of summer convection over the United States.  Specifically, the water vapor, temperature and 
pressure profiles associated with times and areas where the model produces anvils are selected and clustered 
into 40 classes.  The mean extinction profiles at the radiometer frequencies are calculated for every class 
and used in process of calculating the brightness temperatures from the estimated ice profiles using a simple 
Monte Carlo procedure.  That is, given a retrieved ice profile and its scattering property, an anvil class 
and its associated absorption, temperature and pressure profiles are randomly selected and attached to the 
ice scattering properties. To make the procedure physically meaningful, temperature rather than height is 
used in the ice scattering-gas absorption collocation process.  The emissivities are randomly chosen between 
0.8 and 1.0 and assumed constant for all radiometer frequencies.  Brightness temperatures are calculated at 
89-, 183.31 ± 1.1, and 325.15 ± 1.5 GHz, which correspond to three of the 10 channels of the SAPHIR-NG 
radiometer envisioned to be deployed in the AOS mission (Brogniez et al. 2022).  The other channels are 
centered on the same a/water vapor absorption lines and are not likely to offer additional information in 
this rather controlled experiment. Nevertheless, the other channels are expected to be useful in reducing the 
uncertainties caused by variability in the vertical distribution of water vapor, which may be greater in 
real life than in the simulated environment. 

The processing steps used to process the CS reflectivity observations and calculate the lidar, Ku-band and 
submillimeter-wave radiometer observations may be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Derivation of physically consistent radar and radiometer lookup tables to relate basic radar and 
radiometer properties (e.g. reflectivity, attenuation, extinction, scattering-albedo, etc.) to PSD parameters 
such as $IWC$ and $D_m$. The tables are derived for a single of $N_w$, but are usable with any value of 
$N_w$ using the "normalization" operations described in Grecu et al. (2011).
\item Derivation of Nw-relative 
height parameterization using the 2C-ICE product.
\item Estimation of IWC and related PSD parameters from CS W-band radar observations, using the tables constructed
in Step 1 and parameterization derived in Step 2.
\item Calculation of lidar, Ku-band radar and radiometer observations from the estimates derived in Step 3 and 
the tables obtained in Step 1.
\end{enumerate}

The application of these steps produces a large dataset of approximately 200,000 cloud ice profiles and 
associated lidar, radar and radiometer observations that may be used to investigate the synergy of the three 
sensors. Details are provided in the next section.

\subsection{Estimation and evaluation}
Given that the lidar observations may attenuate quickly in thick clouds, while the Ku-band radar will not detect
clouds with an echo weaker than 8.0 dBZ, the radiometer is the instrument likely to provide by itself the most 
complete information about the total amount of ice in its observing volume.  However, the vertical distribution 
of ice is difficult to quantify from radiometer-only observations, because significantly different vertical ice 
distributions may lead to very similar radiometer observations.  This makes radiometer-only retrievals highly 
dependent on the "a priori" information on the distribution of ice clouds in the atmosphere. As previously 
mentioned, this is the reason why CS-based IWC retrievals were preferred to CRM simulations, as retrievals are 
expected to exhibit a more natural and less biased distribution. By the same token, a retrieval procedure whose 
results are intuitively explainable is preferable to a potentially more accurate but less interpretable 
procedure.  Therefore, in this study we use an estimation methodology based on the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) 
algorithm (Hastie et al. 2009). Given a value for k and a brightness temperature input, the KNN regression 
first identifies the k training observations that are closest to the input. It then estimates the variable of 
interest as the weighted average of all the training responses. The algorithm is efficient because, at the 
prediction time, the input is not simply compared to all the records in the training database. Instead, the 
training dataset is recursively partitioned into disjoint structures called quad-trees (de Berg et al. 2008) 
that do not require exhaustive searches for the closest neighbor identification. In this study, we use the kNN 
regression implementation of Pedegrosa et al. (2011).  The number of nearest neighbors, k, is set to 30. 
Results do not appear to be sensitive to the value of k as long is large enough (at least 10) to prevent 
the derivation of noisy estimates. Larger values do not change the estimates noticeably, but can slow the 
estimation process due to extra-processing steps.

Mathematically, the estimation procedure may be mathematically formulated as a function $Y=f(X)$, where $Y$ are 
the ice properties that need to be estimated (e.g. the ice water path (IWC), the IWC at a given height, etc.) 
and $X$ is the set of observations. To investigate the synergy between instruments, we start with $X$ as the 
set of radiometer brightness temperature and continue by adding lidar and radar observations or features. Here, 
a feature is defined as property derived by processing some observations (e.g. the height of the lidar maximum 
backscatter, or the top of the lidar particle backscatter).

A cross validation methodology is used for evaluation.  That is, the kNN regression is trained on 70\% of 
the data and evaluated on the remaining 30\% of the data.  The partition of the data into training and 
evaluation subsets is done randomly.  Usually, the partition, training and evaluation steps are repeating 
several times.  However, given the fact that differences in the relationships between the ice property and 
their associated simulated observations are functions of the meteorological context, and that all regimes are 
well-sampled in both the training and testing subsets (e.g. out of every 10 pixels in a scene, about 7 end-up 
in the training dataset, while the others in the testing dataset), the repetition of the partition, training, 
and evaluation steps multiple times is not necessary. Therefore, in our evaluation, we partition the data into 
training and evaluation only once and perform all the evaluation for a single partition. The evaluation 
criteria include the correlation coefficient, the bias, and visual inspections of graphical representations of 
the estimated properties relative to their references.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Radiometer-only retrievals}
As previously mentioned, submillimeter-wave radiometers are likely to provide by themselves more complete 
information about the total amount of ice in their observing volumes than lidars or Ku-band radars with 
limited sensitivity. However, radiometers observations are an integrated measure of radiative process in 
clouds that provide little information about the vertical distribution of ice. From this perspective, an 
evaluation in terms of the ice water path ($IWP$) defined as the vertical integral of the $IWC$, i.e. 
$IWP=\int_0^{Z_{top}}IWC(z)dz$ is insightful.  Shown in Figure 3 is a frequency contour plot of IWP 
estimated from radiometer-only observations their true values. As apparent in the figure, there is good 
correlation between the retrieved and the true IWP values. The numerical value of the correlation coefficient 
is 0.92, and there is no-overall bias. That is, the mean values of retrieved $IWP$ and true $IWP$ values are 
equal. However, conditional biases are apparent, with overestimation of $IWP$ for values smaller than 
100 g/$m^2$ and some underestimation for values larger than 1000 g/$m^2$.  The biases at the low end of the 
$IWP$ range are not surprising, given that the impact caused by ice scattering on the total radiometric signal 
is small for low values of $IWP$ and hard to distinguished from other sources of variability in radiometer 
observations. Saturation effects are most likely responsible for underestimation at the high end.  It should 
be noted that in this evaluation, only atmospheric profiles that exhibit ice detectable by the CS radar are used. Therefore, a radiometer-only estimation procedure derived from this training dataset is likely to result in significant overestimation if not used in conjunction with a discrimination procedure. However, such procedure is not critical in this study, as the lidar observations may be used to discriminate between clear skies and ice clouds.

    \caption{True and radiometer-only retrieved conditional mean IWC.}\label{f4}
\end{figure}

To express the ability of the radiometer-only methodology to characterize the vertical distribution of ice 
in clouds in a simple way, we define the ice profile gravity center (GC) as 
$z_{GC}=\frac {\int_0^{Z_{top}}zIWC(z)dz} {\int_0^{Z_{top}}IWC(z)dz}$, where $z$ is the distance relative to 
the freezing level, the $Z_{top}$ is the distance from the top of the atmosphere to the freezing level.  
The $IWC$ is estimated using the kNN regression described in section 2.2 and the estimated $z_{GC}$ is 
compared to the true $z_{GC}$.  Results are shown in Figure 4.  It may be observed in the figure that while 
the true $IWC$ gravity center exhibits quite a broad distribution, the one retrieved from the radiometer-only 
observations exhibits a narrow distribution. Moreover, there is almost no correlation between the retrieved 
and the true IWC gravity center.  This is an indication that, while the total amount of ice may be reasonably 
estimated from radiometer-only observations, its vertical distribution can not be determined from 
radiometer-only observations.

    \caption{Same as in Figure 3, but for the $IWC$ gravity center.}\label{f5}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Synergistic retrievals}

From the synergy of the instrument perspective, it is useful to investigate how information easily derivable 
from the active instrument observation can complement the submillimeter-wave radiometer observations. The top of 
the clouds derived from the lidar backscatter observations is such information. To incorporate it into the $IWC$ 
retrievals, we simply extend the dimension of the input by one entry that contains the lidar-based cloud top 
estimate. This additional piece of information makes the retrievals more specific by confining the set of 
potential matches to those that are consistent from the cloud top perspective with the lidar observations.

Shown in Figure 5 is frequency plot of the $IWC$ gravity centers estimated from lidar and radiometer 
observations as a function of the true $IWC$ gravity centers. One may note in the figure a significant 
improvement relative to Figure 4.
